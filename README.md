# To-Do-List
Lock In is a simple todo list website that makes it so you can keep track of what you have to do on that day. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build this.

Features:

1. Allows users to list their tasks
2. Local Storage
3. User-friendly

#How to Use
This website is used in a very simple way. When you load up the webpage you get met with a screen like this:

After, you can type in the tasks that you have to do for the day. For example, lets say you have to clean your room:

This tasks can be interacted with by selecting it, to indicate that you have completed the task, or press the "x" to indicate that you want to remove that task.

#What I Learned

This was my first time programming with Javascript so I learned alot building this website. Some of the concepts I learned was:

- DOM Manipulation
- Event Handling
- Functions
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- Local Storage
- Timeouts
- CSS Transitions

Overall, this project allowed me to get some exposure to Javascript. This allows me to continue advancing in the space of web development and learn more advanced technologies in the future.
